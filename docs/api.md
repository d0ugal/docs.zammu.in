# Trigger your deploys using the API

You could do this to automatically publish your draft pages at the end of each day.

To setup access via the API:

  1. Visit the site details page and click on the *API acess information* link.
  2. Copy the curl code which includes your sites id, your api key and your api secret and run it on the terminal.
  3. Run it on your terminal

**However, make sure that you keep the api_key and the api_secret safe**

If you end up exposing them, you can [reset the api_key and api_secret from the users page](https://zammu.in/keys).
